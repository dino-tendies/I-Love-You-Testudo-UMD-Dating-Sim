# I-Love-You-Testudo-UMD-Dating-Sim
A dating simulator featuring romantic options here at the University of Maryland (april fooooools)

This game is a gigantic april fool's joke-in-progress, mainly done as satire. It's just a big gigantic shitpost about the quirky stuff you find on campus.
This is also a big project for me since I really gotta get back into Unity.
